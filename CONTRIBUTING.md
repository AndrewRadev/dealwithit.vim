# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, you can use the usual github pull-request flow:

1. Fork the project
2. Make your change/addition, preferably in a separate branch.
3. Test the new behaviour and make sure all existing tests pass (optional, see below for more information).
4. Issue a pull request with a description of your feature/bugfix.
